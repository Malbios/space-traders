# TODO

See `docs/05-agent-handoff.md` for full context on each of these.

## Milestone 1: Foundation — done

- [x] Real SQLite schema (§12): full 12-table set, `schema_versions`-tracked migrations.
- [x] WAL mode + `busy_timeout` pragma.
- [x] Migrations (hand-rolled `.sql` + `MigrationRunner.fs`).
- [x] Hourly `VACUUM INTO` backup task with retention.
- [x] Retired the Milestone 0 spike's `spike_workspaces` table / `Persistence.fs`;
      `WorkspaceRemoting.fs` now backed by the real `workspaces` table.
- [x] CI build+test workflow.

## Milestone 2: Real data, no Blockly yet — done

- [x] Token flow (paste an existing SpaceTraders token — see docs/decisions.md).
- [x] Read agent, ships, contracts, waypoints, markets from the real API.
- [x] Minimal single-lane request queue stub (§13 non-negotiable from day one).
- [x] Grew `SpaceKids.FakeSpaceTraders` to cover the endpoints consumed so far; pointed
      integration tests at it.
- [x] Verified against the real live SpaceTraders API, not just the fake.

## Milestone 3: Blockly in German (full integration) — done

- [x] Authored the block catalog (`docs/04-block-catalog.md`) with German labels and DSL
      instruction shapes together (§7).
- [x] Built out the toolbox from the catalog (6 categories).
- [x] Added all primitive German blocks planned for the first release (20 new custom
      blocks; the rest turned out to be stock Blockly blocks already available).
- [x] Save/restore workspace JSON from SQLite (mechanism already proven in Milestone 0).
- [x] Highlight the selected block during a fake/simulated run.

## Milestone 4: DSL and validation

- [ ] Define DSL types: custom-block collection, `callCustomBlock` instruction shape,
      `resultTarget` (§10).
- [ ] Compile a Blockly workspace into DSL, including expression linearization (hoist
      effectful value blocks into instructions writing frame-local temporaries; enforce
      "inline arguments are pure") (§10).
- [ ] Validate DSL: scope checks, custom-block structural mismatch check, transitive-
      closure completeness, cycle detection (§9, §11).
- [ ] Return German validation errors.
